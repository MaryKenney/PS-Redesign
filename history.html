                            In 1980, two guys (Rodney Dobbs and Joe Dickinson) who had worked together at Dallas Repertory Theatre decided to start a theatre of their own.  They found a space in a struggling pocket sandwich shop in a rather questionable area on lower Greenville.  Their goal was to manage to last long enough – a couple of years, maybe – to produce perhaps a dozen shows which they both had long wished to do.  Their venue would consist of unabashedly “entertainment” theatre – comedies and melodramas.  They began with the old American chestnut, “The Drunkard,” with hero to cheer, heroine to sigh for, and villain to jeer and toss popcorn at.

                                They also decided they were overdoing melodramas – so they adopted their current format – i.e., alternating their popcorn-tossing spoofs with “regular” comedies, such as “The Nerd,” “Arsenic And Old Lace,” “Barefoot In The Park,” etc.  They have even tossed in a few “heavier” shows (although still chosen for high entertainment value) such as “Camelot,” “Inherit The Wind,” “Deathtrap,” “Vikings,” etc.  Their musical adaptation of “A Christmas Carol,” has been performed for 37 consecutive holiday seasons, this season.  Their main stage plays are performed four times a week (Thursday through Saturday at 8:00; Sunday at 7:00.)</p>

                                    The Pocket is the last of the Dallas dinner theatres (although the food and beverage service is optional).  We are very proud of the theatre’s large and faithful patron base and of the fact that almost half of our shows are productions of comedies by local playwrights.<br><br>

                                    In 1990, just shy of their tenth year of existence,  Dobbs and Dickinson moved to this larger space in a shopping strip on Mockingbird Lane, and there they have been ever since.  Over the years, five additional partners were acquired with Dobbs and Dickinson remaining the majority stockholders, but now have some partners/friends willing (and a few unwilling) to share the work. </p>

                                        In its almost 40 years, the theatre has produced over 300 shows.  Five of its original plays have been nominated for Leon Rabin Awards for Best Play (three have won).  In 2000, Dickinson received the Leon Rabin Best Actor Award, and in 2004, Dobbs and Dickinson were given the Dallas Theatre League Standing Ovation Award (“Contribution to the advancement of theatre in the Dallas Area which has been extraordinary and deserving of special recognition.”)  It seems that the Pocket may have become a little more acceptable to the theatre community (at least it seems resigned to the fact that it’s not going to go away). <br><br>

                                        There are still folks around, though, who can’t quite accept it – like the theatre professor who, upon hearing that one of his students had been given a role at the Pocket, shuddered and said: “Good Lord – isn’t that the place where they throw food at the actors?” </p>
