          <h1>COVID WARNING</h1>
      <p> With the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the State of Texas encourages everyone to heed the advice of the CDC and U.S. State Department's travel notices, advisories, and recommendations. For interstate travel within the U.S., be sure to check with your destination for any COVID-19 travel advisories and/or closures. </p>
      <p> Governor Greg Abbott has issued several <a href="https://www.dshs.state.tx.us/coronavirus/opentexas.aspx#execorders"></span>Executive Orders</a> detailing the ongoing plan to open businesses and activities in Texas. All newly opened businesses and services are subject to the recommended minimum standard health protocols outlined by DSHS and linked on this page.</p>

            <h2 class="text-center">Every Day Safety Guidelines & Procedures</h2>
            <p>​At the Pocket, we are doing our very best to protect the safety of our patrons, staff, and artists. Pocket Sandwich Theatre (PST) has developed new policies and procedures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These new guidelines were developed based on directives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They also utilize policies that were adopted by other theaters across the United States.<br><br>
              Although we are happy to assist, all ticket purchases will be required to be done online.  If you are feeling unwell, please don’t hesitate to contact our box office in advance to reschedule your visit for a later scheduled performance or a theater credit.  Our box office number is 214-821-1860.<br><br>
              <b>ALL PATRONS MUST ENTER THE THEATER EQUIPPED WITH AND WEARING A MASK.  IF YOU DON'T BRING ONE WE WILL HAVE ONE AVAILABLE FOR YOU AT THE FRONT DOOR.  AT YOUR TABLE THEY CAN BE REMOVED FOR EATING AND DINING BUT THEY MUST BE WORN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TIME AND WHILE ENJOYING THE SHOW.  THIS WON'T LAST FOREVER, YA'LL!</b><br><br>
              We made new reduced seating arrangements that conform to social distancing standards with plexiglass dividers and 6 feet of distancing between floor group seating as well as the stage performers.<br><br>
              PST is fully equipped and will clean and disinfect the facility before and after every performance as well as having a weekly electrostatic spraying service, Enviro-Masters,  which eliminates pathogens even in hidden and shadowed areas, an added reduction to the risk of cross-contamination.Look for their Disinfected and Protected Seal to know our business is working hard to stay ahead of germs! Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCQLx0Ul_a0&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" alt="Youtube video about Enviro-Master cleaning">here</a> to check out a video regarding this treatment.<br><br>
              We have equipped our air conditioning units with the highest-ranked and rated MERV filters for better filtering and air quality.  There are air purifiers thoughout the theater.<br><br>
              All of our kitchen staff and waitstaff will be wearing masks.  All  staff and performers will be temperature checked upon arrival.  Anyone showing any signs of illness will not be allowed to attend or work.<br><br>
              There are disinfection stations throughout the theater.
